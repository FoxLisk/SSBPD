        Hi! If you're confused about what this site's all about, here's some information
        to get you started.
    </p>
    <p>
        First off, an overhead view. SSBPD (for Super Smash Bros. Player Database) is a
        compilation of results from Super Smash Bros. Melee tournaments. The goal is to
        have the most complete possible history of Melee tournaments. We're only really interested
        in singles results right now, and from events that don't place non-standard restrictions on the players -
        for example, tournaments where your choice of characters is restricted (for example "Low Tier" tournaments)
        will not be found here.
    </p>
    <p>
        To that end, one of the major features is the ability to take files generated by
        the most commonly used software organization software, <a href="http://allisbrawl.com/tio/">
            TIO</a>, and organize that information into the tournaments and players you
        see here.
    </p>
    <p>
        So let's go through some of the things you'll see around the site. For example,
        you'll see bits of info like this all over the place:
    </p>
    <p>
        @Html.Raw(Model.player.infoHTML(true, true))
    </p>
    <p>
        The first part, "@Model.player.Tag," is the name the player uses. If you click the
        link, it will take you to a page with a lot of information about that particular
        player.
    </p>
    <p>
        Next up is the little @Html.Raw(Model.player.CharacterMain.ImgTag()) icon - that
        indicates the character that the player uses most. In this case, we learn that @Model.player.Tag
        uses @Model.player.CharacterMain.DisplayString() (you can see the name of a character
        by holding your mouse over the icon).
    </p>
    <p>
        The next bit is a little more involved. The number, @Convert.ToInt32(Model.player.ELO), is the player's
        Elo rating. Very briefly, Elo ratings are a way to measure player skill, determined
        by who they beat and who the lose to. If you want to read more about Elo ratings,
        I would recommend reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system">the
            Wikipedia article</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, we have a flag indicating the country the player hails from - for example,
        @Model.player.Tag here comes from
        @Model.player.Region.DisplayString() (you can find this by hovering over the flag
        once again).
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
        So let's look into the tabs up at the top. First we have <a href="/upload">TO Tools</a>.
        Here you'll find tools meant for use by Tournament Organizers. You can upload Tio
        files here, and you can get your Tio bracket seeded if you're in the midst of running
        a tournament. That's all that's there for now.
    </p>
    <p>
    Next we've got <a href="/player">Players</a>. This is a list of every player we have any data about.
    You can go here or use the search tool to find particular players. If you go to a particular player's page, like, say,
    <a href="@Model.player.URL">@Model.player.Tag</a>, you'll find their entire tournament history. It includes every set
    they've played that we know about, a graph depicting the evolution of their Elo rating over time, and links to
    their histories against their opponents. For example, you can check out <a href="/player/@Model.player.URL/versus/@Model.opponent.URL">@Model.player.Tag versus @Model.opponent.Tag</a> - 
    you can see all of their games and who won and lost each one, at which tournaments.
    </p>
    <p>
    Next is <a href="/tournament">Tournaments</a>. This is a list of all the tournaments that are currently in the system, sortable
    by date or how many entrants (if you're only interested in the big tournaments). On each tournament's page, you can see all the
    events played at that tournament. <a href="/tournament/@Model.tournament.TournamentID">Check it out</a>!
    </p>
